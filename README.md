## üìÇ Project Structure

The project has been developed in **three stages**:

### 1. Proposal Report

* Introduced **organization background, problem statements, and expected outcomes**.
* Highlighted challenges such as **overstocking, digital payment resistance, poor credit management, manpower shortage, and limited marketing**.
* Outlined **problem-solving approach** with inventory optimization, digital payment adoption, systematic credit policies, and marketing improvements.
* **TA Remarks:**

  * Executive summary should include a short note on analysis methods.
  * Add business turnover in background.
  * Merge payment-related problems into a single statement.
  * Problem-solving approach should be divided into **Data Collection, Methods, Tools**.
  * Outcomes should be **point-wise** and elaborated.

### 2. Mid-Term Report

* Data collected from **August 5, 2024, to October 31, 2024**, recorded in Excel (clarification needed whether manually entered or digital export).
* Initial descriptive statistics prepared.
* Preliminary analysis with **box plots, histograms, and pie charts** to highlight sales patterns and outliers.
* **TA Remarks:**

  * Executive summary should reflect **data collected, methods used, and findings**, not just proposal summary.
  * Descriptive statistics should be presented in **tables with interpretations**.
  * Graphs must be shifted to **Results & Findings**, while the **Analysis Process** should describe **step-by-step methods**.
  * Avoid pie charts with too many categories; use **bar charts instead**.

---

### 3. End-Term Report

* Advanced analysis performed using **time-series graphs, bar charts, and line charts** to study sales trends, seasonal demand, and cash flow constraints.
* Extracted sales information directly from **BusyWin management software** (requires specifying exact data fields used).
* Identified inefficiencies in inventory, cash flow, and manpower management.
* Proposed **actionable strategies**:

  * Digital payment integration with UPI/QR codes.
  * Systematic credit records with WhatsApp reminders.
  * Hiring seasonal staff during peak periods.
  * Store layout optimization and vertical shelving.
  * Low-cost marketing via WhatsApp & local pamphlets.
* **TA Remarks:**

  * Executive summary needs **specific metrics** (e.g., % cash flow constraint, financial loss).
  * Analysis methods must explain **how each graph type was applied**.
  * Graph explanations should include **causal insights**, not generic descriptions.
  * Sales data fields from BusyWin must be specified, along with limitations.
  * Statistical analysis should complement visualizations.
